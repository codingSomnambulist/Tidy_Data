# Tidy_Data
##### This is the README for the Course Project for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
##### There is only a single script, Run_analysis.R, that works as long as you have the UCI HAR dataset unzipped in your working directory. The script is designed to run on RStudio for Windows, so YMMV if your system is different.
